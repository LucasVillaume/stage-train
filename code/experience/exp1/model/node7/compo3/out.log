Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-06-22 18:01:44.
Progress(34) at 2025-06-22 18:01:44: 102 states generated, 35 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking temporal properties for the complete state space with 35 total distinct states at (2025-06-22 18:01:44)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2025-06-22 18:01:44
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.3E-16
102 states generated, 35 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 34.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 2 and the 95th percentile is 1).
