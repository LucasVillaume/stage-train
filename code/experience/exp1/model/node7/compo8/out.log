Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-06-22 18:26:24.
Progress(47) at 2025-06-22 18:26:25: 1,088 states generated, 342 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking temporal properties for the complete state space with 342 total distinct states at (2025-06-22 18:26:25)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2025-06-22 18:26:26
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.4E-14
1088 states generated, 342 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 47.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 3 and the 95th percentile is 2).
