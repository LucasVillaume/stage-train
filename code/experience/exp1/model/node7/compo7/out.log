Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-06-22 18:08:09.
Progress(40) at 2025-06-22 18:08:10: 746 states generated, 244 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking temporal properties for the complete state space with 244 total distinct states at (2025-06-22 18:08:10)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2025-06-22 18:08:10
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 6.6E-15
746 states generated, 244 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 40.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 2 and the 95th percentile is 2).
