Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-06-22 18:58:20.
Progress(58) at 2025-06-22 18:58:20: 244 states generated, 83 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking temporal properties for the complete state space with 83 total distinct states at (2025-06-22 18:58:20)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2025-06-22 18:58:20
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 7.2E-16
244 states generated, 83 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 58.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 2 and the 95th percentile is 2).
