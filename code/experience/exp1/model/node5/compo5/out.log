Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-06-22 17:49:55.
Progress(39) at 2025-06-22 17:49:57: 731 states generated, 239 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking temporal properties for the complete state space with 239 total distinct states at (2025-06-22 17:49:57)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2025-06-22 17:49:57
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 6.4E-15
731 states generated, 239 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 39.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 2 and the 95th percentile is 2).
