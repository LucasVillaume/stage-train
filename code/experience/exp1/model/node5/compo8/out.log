Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2025-06-22 18:50:54
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 6.2E-13
7294 states generated, 2268 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 54.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 3 and the 95th percentile is 2).
