Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-06-22 18:39:40.
Progress(43) at 2025-06-22 18:39:41: 127 states generated, 44 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking temporal properties for the complete state space with 44 total distinct states at (2025-06-22 18:39:41)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2025-06-22 18:39:41
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.0E-16
127 states generated, 44 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 43.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 2 and the 95th percentile is 1).
