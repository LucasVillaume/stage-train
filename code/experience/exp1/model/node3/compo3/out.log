Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-06-22 18:51:08.
Progress(48) at 2025-06-22 18:51:09: 958 states generated, 314 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.

Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2025-06-22 18:51:10
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.1E-14
958 states generated, 314 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 48.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 2 and the 95th percentile is 2).
