Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-06-22 19:17:48.
Progress(46) at 2025-06-22 19:17:48: 1,210 states generated, 383 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.

Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2025-06-22 19:17:48
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.7E-14
1210 states generated, 383 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 46.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 3 and the 95th percentile is 2).
