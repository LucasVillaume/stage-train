Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-06-22 19:06:22.
Progress(62) at 2025-06-22 19:06:25: 14,018 states generated, 4,241 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.

Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2025-06-22 19:06:25
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.2E-12
14018 states generated, 4241 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 62.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 4 and the 95th percentile is 3).
